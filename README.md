This code is a GUI application that allows users to encrypt and decrypt images using a Caesar cipher algorithm. The application uses the Tkinter library for the GUI, and the PIL library to work with images.

The encryption process involves opening an image file, converting it to a NumPy array, and adding an encryption key to each pixel value. The resulting array is then saved as a CSV file.

The decryption process involves selecting a CSV file, converting it back to a NumPy array, subtracting a decryption key from each pixel value, and saving the resulting array as a new image file.

The application also includes a function to display the original image and buttons to browse for an image, encrypt it, decrypt it, and display the original image. The application uses labels and entries to prompt the user for the encryption and decryption keys.

The application also includes a function to display a temporary message for a few seconds, which is used to notify the user of any errors or success messages.
